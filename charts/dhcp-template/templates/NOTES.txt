The agents will periodically send their current dhcp lease to the operator, when they are ready.
The operator will reconcile templates as soon as at least one agent is ready.
Changes to the templates or from the leases are throttled to not reconcile immediately.
You can expect changes to be applied in less than a minute after they happen.
